# ESPACE-CHEVAL

The goal of this projet was to rewrite the front-end side of an old website in
order to make it more appealing to potential clients. If you wish to see the
difference between the final results I obtained and the original website, I
invite you to have a look at this pdf: "./old-espace-cheval-fr.pdf"

## Technologies:

	+ HTML5 & CSS3
	+ Bootstrap 3.4 via CDN

## Todos
+ see if I can make the nav more responsible
+ see if I can get the footer to stay at the bottom on all devices
+ see if I can find better imgs for the carousel (no Â© especially)
