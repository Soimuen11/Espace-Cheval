# ESPACE-CHEVAL

The main goal of this projet was to rewrite the front-end side of an old
website in order to make it more appealing to potential clients. If you wish to
see the difference between the final results I obtained and the original
website, I invite you to have a look at this pdf: "./old-espace-cheval-fr.pdf"

## Technologies:

	+ HTML5 & CSS3
	+ Bootstrap 3.4 via CDN

## Main differences between old & new website

	+ Responsivity: The old version was old-school looking and not very
	  appealing. This new website is written with bootstrap and is functional
	  on all devices. 
	+ User-friendliness: The main issue with the old website was not its
	  design. It rather was how the chaotic display of its content. Everything
	  is now accessible and properly ordered in a navbar and various dropdown
	  menus.

## Todos

+ Improve responsivity on smaller screens, especially tablet screens such as IPad.
+ Improve responsivity of the footer.
